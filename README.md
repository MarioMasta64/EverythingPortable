# READ THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE ASKING

**if you download one of these seperately download wget.exe**

**https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/current/ (the latest 32bit one) place it in a folder called "bin"**

# if you message me on twitter about it you did not read this

**also as a somewhat sidenote the .exe is on the release page because wget is no longer downloaded properly**

# for now this project is abandoned

**most things may still work and i may pick it back up if there is interest but its grown boring to me since people only ever tell you when something doesnt work it kills the joy of creating something honestly**

# also issues are to be reported here:

**https://github.com/MarioMasta64/EverythingPortable/issues/14**
